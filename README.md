# BFIBundle

The purpose of this library is to help users interact with the bacterial-fungal-interactions database, found on the [BFI Research Portal](https://sfa-bfi.edgebioinformatics.org/about) interact with the data programatically. This is a lightweight wrapper around a few api endpoints. The package also has a few helper functions to link up doi's and quick search papers.
